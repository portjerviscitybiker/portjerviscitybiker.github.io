    <p> Hello Josh.  What do you think of my Git Hub page?  </p>
		    
		    
		    
    <p> My next step is to learn how to link the Style page to mine in git hub... Now I know inorder for that to work outside of github, the Style 
	    page and the landing page need to be in the same local folder...  Is it the same for a github repository?  </p>

	 
	  
	  
	  <p> It's pretty basic stuff, but its a functional page, which is pretty dam cool I think! </p>
