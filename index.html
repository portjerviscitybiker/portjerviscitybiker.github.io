		    <p> Dr Doom, or NYU economics proffessor Nouriel Roubini, has predected that the economic shit is about to really hit the fan.  He correctly predicted the stock crash of 2008, and how his predicitons of econonic turbulence are worse than ever!</p>
		    
		    
    <!--- <p> Hello bikers of Port Jervis!  Welcome to my Git hub page.  As you can see, it needs some work.</p>
		    
		    
		    
    <p> My next step is to learn how to link the Style page to mine in git hub... Now I know inorder for that to work on a real website, the Style 
	    page and the landing page need to be in the same local folder, but Github is tricky, and I do not know how yet...</p>

	 
	  
	  
	  <p> Well, that is all for now.  I look forward to developing my github skills, just for fun. </p>
		    
		    <p>Keep riding Everyone!</p> -->
