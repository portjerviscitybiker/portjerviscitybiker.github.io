    <p> Hello bikers of Port Jervis!  Welcome to my Git hub page.  As you can see, it needs some work.</p>
		    
		    
		    
    <p> My next step is to learn how to link the Style page to mine in git hub... Now I know inorder for that to work on a real website, the Style 
	    page and the landing page need to be in the same local folder, but Github is tricky, and I do not know how yet...</p>

	 
	  
	  
	  <p> Well, that is all for now.  I look forward to developing my github skills, just for fun. </p>
		    
		    <p>Keep riding Everyone!</p>
