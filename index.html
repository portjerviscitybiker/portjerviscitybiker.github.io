		    <p> Dr Doom, or NYU economics proffessor Nouriel Roubini, has predected that the economic shit is about to really hit the fan!  He correctly predicted the stock crash of 2008, and now his predicitons of econonic turbulence are worse than ever!
		    
		    And this could not have come at a worse time.  Between Americans still reeling from COVID, the tight race for election to congress, as well as many other important offices, we really would have appreciated some good news on the horizon!
			    
			    But not today!  With no fantastic four to battle him, Dr. Doom has arrived with weapons of dismal econonomic outlook for any stock or crypto buyers.  His advice for getting through this difficult time is the same as always:  Pay off credit cards and other high interest debt, and make sure you have a cash emergency fund.

    <!-- <p> Hello bikers of Port Jervis!  Welcome to my Git hub page.  As you can see, it needs some work.</p>
		    
		    
		    
    <p> My next step is to learn how to link the Style page to mine in git hub... Now I know inorder for that to work on a real website, the Style 
	    page and the landing page need to be in the same local folder, but Github is tricky, and I do not know how yet...</p>

	 
	  
	  
	  <p> Well, that is all for now.  I look forward to developing my github skills, just for fun. </p>
		    
		    <p>Keep riding Everyone!</p> -->
