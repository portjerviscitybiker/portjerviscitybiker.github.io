		   <!-- <p> Is it getting hotter out there?  It sure seems like it!  I cannot believe how many people still deny climate change is real. </p>

		    <p> Well, I hope everyone is taking this environmental issue seriously.  The fact is we can make a change.  If more of us focus on recycling our cardboard and 
			    allumium, and try and reduce driving, as well as put more sun screen on, we may just pull through this planetary challenge we are facing. </p>

		    <p> As a boy who loved hiking with family, I have always felt/imagined a strong connection to the fresh air and quiet of hiking in a mountainous area, and as such
			    have always believed very strongly in protecting our planet, mother gia.  But for those who are less spirtitual and more pragmatic than I, I began to follow the work
			    of Elon Musk, owner of Solar city, amoung other businesses, as well as a group known as the Solar Punks:  a group of artists who envision a world where technology and 
			    plant life work togehter harmionously.  </p> -->

		    <!-- <p> Dr Doom, or NYU economics proffessor Nouriel Roubini, has predected that the economic shit is about to really hit the fan!  He correctly predicted the stock crash of 2008, and now his predicitons of econonic turbulence are worse than ever!
		    
		   	 And this could not have come at a worse time.  Between Americans still reeling from COVID, the tight race for election to congress, as well as many other important offices, we really would have appreciated some good news on the horizon!
			    
			    But not today!  With no fantastic four to battle him, Dr. Doom has arrived with weapons of dismal econonomic outlook for any stock or crypto buyers.  His advice for getting through this difficult time is the same as always:  Pay off credit cards and other high interest debt, and make sure you have a cash emergency fund.
